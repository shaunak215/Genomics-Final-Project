Eduardo and Shaunak 
We decided to split up the following parts, and we ended up working on 
most of the pieces together in a partner-programming style: visualizer, 
generator, and checker. We first worked on the visualizer and graph 
format storage, and did all of this together in the early stages. 
The generator was relatively straight-forward, and we did most of the 
intial logic together. After it was complete, Shaunak refactored and cleaned 
up the code, and Eduardo added more detailed messages for the user (i.e. 
what parts of the graph weren't WG compliant). We did all of the logic for 
the generator together, and after we had something working Shaunak refactored 
code, and Eduardo did the testing/ data analysis for getting more accurate 
node counts. 

Kuanhao 
- did all work related to the Recognizer 

Beril 
- did all work related to the pattern matching. 


We each wrote up our respective parts in the final paper.
